# LCCode-VocabularyTrainer2
A vocabulary trainer in python using Linked Communicating Code (experiment)

## What is this?

This vocabulary trainer is developed in a specific way I want to experiment with.
It is actually mostly written by ChatGPT4. The prompts for the files are preserved
in the markdown file with the same name as the python file next to it.

The general modifier is:
```
Please write the code in the following way: 

1. The source code must be capable of achieving the required technical result.
2. The source code should use all available elements not relevant to the first goal, to adhere to the principles of clear communication, thereby preserving its connection to the business problem.

The elements you may use to communicate the connection with the business problem are:
- variable names
- class names
- method names
- the general structure of the code (e.g. how you split it into separate functions)
- comments

The rules are:
- Make sure that the elements are used unambiguous and remain connected to the business problem context.
- Does the code make sense? ("Can you comprehend what is being said?")
- Is the connection to the business problem convincing "at face value"?
- Are no intermediate steps missing?
  
Please write the code in python.
```

It is the current (30.07.2023) result of a thought, that "clean code" may actually suffer from a definition that is too technical.
Another approach that is focused on communication may (or may not) be more clear.

Just testing. :)
